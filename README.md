# Geolocation Data Preprocessing and Clustering Project
This project showcases my skills in geolocation data preprocessing and clustering, along with proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning evaluation.
## Project Summary
In this project, I worked on cleaning and preprocessing geolocation data to make it suitable for clustering analysis. Using Python, I transformed raw data into a structured format, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

I then visualized the geolocation data using interactive maps and graphs, providing valuable insights into its geographic distribution. This skill allowed me to communicate complex information effectively.

Next, I applied clustering algorithms, starting with the widely-used K-Means, to identify distinct clusters within the data. I advanced to more sophisticated techniques like DBSCAN, which detected clusters of varying shapes and sizes, revealing deeper patterns.

Throughout the project, I honed my skills in evaluating clustering models and understanding their strengths and limitations. I also explored HDBSCAN, an improved version of DBSCAN, to further refine the clustering process
